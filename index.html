	      <p>Some cats, you have prepared drinking water for them, but they have to drink some other water. It's incredible to think about it. It can be analyzed from the following reasons. First of all, you should also notice that cats like to drink the water from the tap. In fact, they are interested in the shining water and have a playful mood. There are many cats who often drink water from the automatic drinking machine. The cat who wants to drink the water in the vase may think that the water without bleaching powder after a little time is very good. For such a cat, you give it cool, I think it is also very like to drink it.</p>

<div id="section1" class="container-fluid bg-warning text-white" style="padding-top:400px;padding-bottom:70px">
  <h1>sleep sleep sleep!</h1>
  <p>the first cold knowledge is cat's sleep. Cats spend two-thirds of their sleep time on average every day, which means that if a cat is nine years old, it will only be awake for three years and spend the rest of its sleep.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2" class="container-fluid bg-white" style="padding-top:400px;padding-bottom:70px">
  <h1>Flying cat</h1>
  <p>
It is often seen that cats fall from a height of more than 20 meters and are still safe. In fact, this is because they have "righting reflex". The cat's eyes and inner ear balance organs will tell the cat where it is in the air, so cats can land with their feet accurately. Even if the cat has no tail, it also has this ability. However, the excrement shoveling officers should not ignore the cat because of this. They should take protective measures for the cat at home and try their best not to hurt the cat.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-warning text-white" style="padding-top:400px;padding-bottom:30px">
  <h1>Cats are left-handed, too</h1>
  <p>Female cats usually use their right paws, but male cats like to use their left paws, which seems a bit similar to us. 90% of right-handed people in humans are mostly female, while the remaining 10% of left-handed people are usually male.</p>
</div>


<div id="section41" class="container-fluid bg-white" style="padding-top:400px;padding-bottom:70px">
  <h1>Hair loss</h1>
  <p>In recent years, we often hear the rumor that puppet cats don't lose their hair. We can't believe this kind of hype. As long as it's a cat, it will lose its hair. It's just that the puppet cat's hair density is relatively large, and its medium and long hair is relatively soft, so it won't knot easily, and the phenomenon of natural hair loss is relatively less, but it's not the fable that it doesn't lose hair. I hope that the excrement shoveling officers should pay attention to the daily care of cats, and use the unique accurate and nutritious care of cats' hair.</p>
</div>


<div id="section42" class="container-fluid bg-warning text-white" style="padding-top:400px;padding-bottom:70px">
  <h1>feeling</h1>
  <p>Many people say that puppet cats are not afraid of pain, but it is not. This is because they are following the rule of survival of the fittest. Because cats are small animals, their every move is very important. If they are slack, they will be targeted by prey, so even if they are injured, they will try to make themselves more normal and hide their weaknesses. Over time, the habit will be gradually consolidated and strengthened in the evolution process.</p>
